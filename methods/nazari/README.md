# Nazari et al.

Code within this folder is based on the code in [https://github.com/OptMLGroup/VRP-RL](https://github.com/OptMLGroup/VRP-RL) which is an implementation of [Reinforcement Learning for Solving the Vehicle Routing Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04240v2).

Only the VRP code is considered, with code relating to the TSP disregarded. The source of the code in each file is given below:
- [task_specific_params.py](task_specific_params.py) - file of the same name
- [utils.py](utils.py) - misc_utils.py and vrp_utils (updated to handle later Tensorflow version)
- [attention.py](attention.py) - vrp_attention.py
