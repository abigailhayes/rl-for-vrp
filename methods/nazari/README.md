# Nazari et al.

Code within this folder is based on the code in [https://github.com/OptMLGroup/VRP-RL](https://github.com/OptMLGroup/VRP-RL) which is an implementation of [Reinforcement Learning for Solving the Vehicle Routing Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04240v2).

Only the VRP code is considered, with code relating to the TSP disregarded.
